# KerbalWitchery : for Kerbal Space Program

*Removes some Kerbal witchery from spaceflight and science mechanics (to add realism)*

#### Spaceflight

* Reaction wheels have been nerfed severely, making RCS essential on most craft
* Most engines have greatly reduced throttle range, so different types are needed for different maneuvers
* Engines have limited ignitions + failure modes, so burns need more planning
* Engine costs are greatly increased, so recovery and engine choice are more impactful
* SRBs have much lower relative costs, along with a thrust curve based on circular grain shape

#### Science

* Sensors and scanners transmit 100% data value
* Materials bay requires lab to reset
* Replaced lab converter with stronger internal experiments
* Added science fraction system from Breaking Ground DLC to more experiment types:

| Fraction | Crew Report | Goo Observation | Materials Study | Surface Sample |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| 33% | 1 crew |  |  | Surface Scanner |
| 50% |  | Mystery Goo | Materials Bay |  |
| 66% | >1 crew |  |  | EVA Sample |
| 100% | Lab only | Lab only | Lab only | Lab only |

#### Interactions

* Recommended as part of the [Career Rebalanced Modpack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/205814-112x-career-rebalanced-modpack/)
* Changes affect all mod parts
* Mods assisting spent stage recovery may be useful (e.g. PRE, FMRS, Stage Recovery)
* Conflicts with similar balance mods (e.g. MandatoryRCS, BetterSRBs, EngineIgnited)
