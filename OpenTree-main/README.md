# OpenTree

A modified tech tree with clearer choices and development. Supports CTT and mod parts.

### Features

* Increased player freedom with more options available from the start: crewed/uncrewed rovers, crewed rockets, probes, planes and drones.
* Entry level tech offers the bare minimum to provide a fun and interesting challenge.
* Tech development is based on finer levels of control and ease of use - not just increasing power.
* The parts contained in each tech either work well together or are related in function. No more illogical groupings.

### Specifics

* Choose between crewed or uncrewed tech in the new game options.
* Launch your first plane/drone with solid fuel boosters, and your first rocket/probe with mono-propellant... or go for a drive around KSC with a rover.
* Earlier access to docking ports, RCS, cargo bays, ISRU and turbojet engines.
* Points of entry to Mk2, Mk3, 2.5m and 3.75m parts from both rocketry and aviation lines.
* Players are encouraged to lower the science rewards rate for a greater challenge - OpenTree has been balance tested down to 30% science rewards.
 
To install simply extract to your KSP installation directory. When installing for the first time, please start a new game.
